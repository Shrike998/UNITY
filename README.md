# UNITY

An alternative to politics. Using technology to provide communities of any size with a benevolent dictatorship.

Why?

- Traditional politics has clearly run its course as the globally recognised way humanity makes its big decisions, based on recent political events spiraling into chaos in both the UK and USA, as well as the world over. The problem is that politics is simply to arcaic and clunky to work in the digitaly agile world we now live in. With things happening in hours and minuites, not days, weeks or even years, we need a new system to govern human society and look after the other life as well. 
- We are now in a unique position for the first time in human history whereby we have the technological know-how and required infrastructure to update this outdated system. 
- Because humans are fundimentaly corruptable. Absolute power corrupts absolutly, and because we can design a system to safe guard against human corruption to make the planet a much more equal place for all involved. 

How?

- Basicly.. Imagine an app that can be installed on your phone/PC/laptop or tablet. On the app you are able to submit ideas for voting on at any scale you choose (local, national, even global). You are also abe to view and vote on ideas submitted by other people.
- The app uses an algorithum to sort voters into a influence hirerchy based on thier previous voting activity. The voting is split up into 'vote stages' with each stage needing a mjority to move to the next stage, the vote stages get bigger in number of voters per stage as they move to the next. The algorithum is designed to ensure that people with "good" ideas (as voted on by a strong majority of people) are often selected to vote at the starting stages, effectivly giving them a greater level of influence in the vote.
- To retain thier position of high influence the voters must continue to submit ideas that people like, but this gets exponentoiely harder as a voter gains more influence, as there voting activity must also increase in respect to thier influence level (they will be getting more votes through to vote on). 

It sounds complex.. and it is.. a bit. But if you spend some time to think it through, what we have here is the basic blueprint for a self balencing social system that could be adopted by a community of any size to allow them to govern themselves and make decisions. Of course there are some bits to elaborate on and some other bits which are not mentioned here. But the basics are laid out. 

The system would have to be built using a blockchain or other decentralised, transparent and secure platform to ensure that no one could hire a hacker and start tampering with the votes. 

Im looking for anyone who has knowledge of developing systems that sound similar to this. Or anyone who would want to get involved in bringing this project into a reality. 

I hope we can get something cobbled together that we can then test in some small groups with fictional ideas/decisions to see how it would play out. In the long run, I hope we can bring this system to the world and provide a feasable alternative to the current outdated political systems. 

Thanks for reading.
